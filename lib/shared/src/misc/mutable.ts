/**
 * Mutable is a class that helps you mutate an immutable state in such a way
 * that changes are observable. It uses ImmerJS under the hood to ensure to
 * ensure mutations are immutable...ðŸ¤”
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const quinn = {name: 'quinn'', age: 20}
 * const slack = {name: 'slack', age: 25}
 * const originalState = [quinn, slack]
 * const state = new Mutable<Array<{name: string, age: number}>>(originalState)
 *
 * const stateChanges = state.changes.map(console.log)
 *
 * state.mutate(draft => {
 *  // You can mutate the state as if you had a mutable reference
 *   draft[1].name = 'beyang'
 *   return draft
 * })
 *
 * // Prints: [{name: 'quinn', age: 20}, {name: 'beyang', age: 25}]
 * // BUT! now for the magic part:
 * originalState[0] === quinn // true
 * originalState[1] === slack // true
 * ```
